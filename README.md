# the link to the data set used in the python prgoram is the following:
# https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data.
# on this page you will have to scroll down and use the JSON version of the dataset
# this dataset must be downloaded and stored in the same directory as this python file
# is in. in order for it to work, the name of the JSON file must be given as an argument.
# when running this python file in your shell.

# so the command should look like following (within the right directory): 
python3 rm_covid.py (the name of your saved JSON-file without these brackets)
